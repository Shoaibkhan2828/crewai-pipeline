🚀 Built an Agentic Architecture for Automated Data Analysis with CrewAI 🤖📊
Excited to share my recent project where I built a data analysis pipeline using the CrewAI framework, showcasing the power of agentic workflows in real-world data analysis tasks.
🔍 Here’s what the system does:
👥 Multiple Autonomous Agents, Each with a Mission:
• Data_Collection_Agent: Extracts initial insights using the Data_Collection_Tool(Uses custom tool).
• Data_Cleaning_Agent: Cleans and prepares the data with the Data_Cleaning_Tool (Uses custom tool).
• Data_Analysing_Agent: Digs into the data to identify trends and patterns.
• Data_Plotting_Agent (WIP): Designed for visualizations (Uses CodeInterpreterTool tool to write execute the code presented by the agent and plots a graph).
🛠️ Tools and Workflow Orchestration:
Leveraged tools like pandas, CrewAI[tools], and Gemini.
Tasks were structured with dependencies to enforce a logical pipeline:
Collect ➡️ Clean ➡️ Analyze ➡️ Visualize
The Crew object acted as managing task execution and inter-agent communication.
📂 Use Case:
 Tested on the california_housing_test.csv dataset, the system:
Analyzed dataset shape, null values, and data types.
Normalized and cleaned data.
Provided automated, structured insights — all agent-driven.

The screenshots below are the outputs given by CrewAI agents.
